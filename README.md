Daily Data Dashboard (Backend)
==============================
This is a personal project that fetches day-to-day data that I am interested in from different web sources and displays them in a data dashboard. It uses C# and ASP.NET for the backend.

The project is developed using TDD (test driven development) methodology and is designed to be extensible to accommodate different data sources in the future.
